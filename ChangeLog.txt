v2.x - 2017-xx-xx
=================

- Allow username and password to be zero length (as opposed to not being
  present). Closes #80.
- Allow zero length client ids when using MQTT v3.1.1.
- Add SSLContext support, including SNI. Closes #11.
- Remove support for SSL without SSLContext (Requires Python 2.7.9+ or 3.2+).
  Closes #115.
- Move unit tests to pytest (#164)

v1.2.2 - 2017-04-11
===================

- Fix message lost when using paho.mqtt.publish helper with QoS=0 message.
  Closes #172.

v1.2.1 - 2017-04-03
===================

- Handle unicode username and passwords correctly. Closes #79.
- Fix handling of invalid UTF-8 topics on incoming messages - the library now
  does not attempt to decode the topic - this will happen when the user
  accesses msg.topic in the on_message callback. If the topic is not valid
  UTF-8, an exception will be raised. Closes #75.
- Fix issue with WebSocket connection in case of network issue (timeout or
  connection broken). Closes #105.
- Fix issue with SSL connection, where latest incoming message may be delayed
  or never processed. Closes #131.
- Fix possible message lost with publish.single and publish.multiple. Closes
  #119.


v1.2 - 2016-06-03
=================

- Client.publish() now returns an MQTTMessageInfo object. The MQTTMessageInfo
  object behaves like a tuple of (rc, mid) for backwards compatibility but
  also provides two functions: is_published() and wait_for_published().
  This allows a client to determine whether any given message has been
  published without need for a callback, and also allows the client to block
  waiting until the message has been sent.
- Further fix for Client constructor for the case where "localhost" is
  unresolvable.
- Add paho.mqtt.subscribe module, with simple() and callback() helper
  functions.
- Allow ^C to interrupt client loop.
- Fix for keepalive=0 causing an infinite disconnect/reconnect loop. Closes
  #42.
- Modify callbacks definition/structure to allow classical inheritence. Closes
  #53, #54.
- Add websockets support.
- Default MQTT version is again changed to v3.1.1.
- Client.subscribe() now accepts unicode type topic inputs on Python 2. Closes
  #16.
- paho.mqtt.publish() now raises an MQTTException on a CONNECT failure, rather
  than blindly continuing. Closes #6.
- Don't block on TLS sockets on Python 3. Closes #2.
- Client.publish() now accepts bytes() payloads on Python 3. Closes #1.
- Don't attempt to join() own thread. Closes #14.
- Allow the use of Client.message_callback_add() from inside callbacks. Closes
  #12.
- Use a monotonic time source for keeping track of time, if available. Closes
  #56.


v1.1 - 2015-01-30
=================

- Add support for wildcard certificates. Closes #440547.
- Default connection behaviour has been reverted to MQTT v3.1 instead of
  v3.1.1. There is as yet insufficient support for v3.1.1 to rely on, and
  current v3.1 implementations do not return the correct CONNACK code to allow
  detection of the fault. Closes #451735.
- Fix incorrect handling of queued messages after reconnecting. Closes
  #452672.
- Fix possible race condition if the connection in loop_start() does not
  complete before loop_stop() is called, meaning the network thread never
  ends. Closes #448428. Thanks to Kees Bakker.


v1.0.2 - 2014-09-13
===================

- Fix "protocol" not being used in publish.single()
- Fix Client constructor for the case where "localhost" is unresolvable.
  Closes #439277.
- Don't attempt to encode topic to utf-8 twice. Thanks to Luc Milland.
- Handle "unicode" type payloads on Python 2.7. Thanks to Luc Milland.
- Fix reconnecting after sending more QoS>0 messages than inflight messages is
  set to, whilst connecting.  Closes #443935. Thanks to Hiram van Paassen.
- Fix possible race condition when connecting with TLS and publishing at the
  same time, which could lead to PUBLISH data being sent before any other
  messages and unencrypted. Closes #443964. Thanks to Hiram van Paassen.
- Handle exceptions from select() in client loop() function. Closes #443881.
  Thanks to Jeff Jasper.


v1.0.1
======

- Fix incorrect reconnect that occurred if calling loop_stop() before
  disconnect().

v1.0

- Add support for "session present" flag in on_connect callback.

v0.9.1
======

- Fix CONNECT packet for MQTT v3.1.1.
