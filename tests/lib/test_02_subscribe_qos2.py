# Test whether a client sends a correct SUBSCRIBE to a topic with QoS 2.

# The client should connect with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id subscribe-qos2-test
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK and verifying that rc=0, the client should send a SUBSCRIBE
# message to subscribe to topic "qos2/test" with QoS=2. If rc!=0, the client
# should exit with an error.
# Upon receiving the correct SUBSCRIBE message, the test will reply with a
# SUBACK message with the accepted QoS set to 2. On receiving the SUBACK
# message, the client should send a DISCONNECT message.
